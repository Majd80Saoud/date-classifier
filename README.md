# date-classifier

This project classifies dates into two types: Sukkari and Khalas using a machine learning model trained with Google Teachable Machine.

## Overview

The model uses image data to distinguish between two types of dates. It is built with TensorFlow and Keras, and runs on Google Colab.

## Features

- Classify dates as Sukkari or Khalas.
- Uses image inputs for training and prediction.
- Implemented in Google Colab for easy access.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow & Keras (pre-installed on Google Colab)
- Google Colab account

### How to Use

1. Upload your images folder to the Colab environment.
2. Open the provided Colab notebook (`notebook.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells to train the model or load a pre-trained model.
4. Use the classification function to predict new images.
